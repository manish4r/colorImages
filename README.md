# colorImages

This is a repository forked from [DeOldify, a Deep Learning based project for colorizing and restoring old images](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) with a gradio-based web-interface as FrontEnd and python as backend .
To use first install the pre-requisites :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then run

`python colorize_app.py`

this will give you a local frontend server running on http://127.0.0.1:7860/ where you can input the image url and perform conversion.
